Key points:

Hundreds have rallied outside Parliament House against what they say is an inconsistent approach to refugee visas
The federal government recently announced 19,000 temporary visa holders would be eligible to apply for permanent visas
The government says anyone who arrives illegally by boat will have no chance of permanent settlement
It is a familiar story for those on bridging visas. The passenger sitting next to them on a crowded boat bound for Australia now has a pathway to permanent residency while they have to apply for a new visa every six months .`;
